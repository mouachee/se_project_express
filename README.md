# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

# SPRINT 12 PROJECT

This back-end project utilizes Mongoose to establish a connection between a Node.js application and a MongoDB database. The project involves defining schemas to structure the data and handles various types of requests to the server. Specifically, it supports operations to get, create, and delete items and users.
